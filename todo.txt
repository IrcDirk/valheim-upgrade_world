- visualize exclusion points (cylinders?)
- visualize which zones are included (draw zone corners without overlap)
- regenerate_location ???: nukes only a location (removes everything within exterior and respawns?)

- All commands should support being centered around the player or around a given location.
 * Amount of parameters? First is radius? If others then those are coordinates.
- Merge count_all and count, and add wild card support (same for remove).
 * Paging doesn't seem to be needed? (Verify that all is shown.)
- Make commands print affected zones at start, but start executing after putting "start"
 * Users would get some idea what would happen.
- Command to remove entities by component (some common ones like container, structure, creature).
 * First step for automatic base detection.

- Operation split to instant and delayed operations. Delayed operations print some initial output but require start command to execute,
- Removed query command as obsolete.
