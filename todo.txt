- upgrade_chests:
 - finds predefined locations
 - searches for predefined chests
 - if predefined item is missing then rolls drops
 - adds the predefined item if rolled item
- visualize exclusion points (cylinders?)
- visualize which zones are included (draw zone corners without overlap)
- regenerate_location ???: nukes only a location (removes everything within exterior and respawns?)

Changes:

- Regeneration commands renamed to destroy to make the effect more clear.
- New commands for generating areas without having to physically go there.
- New command for counting amount of entities.
- New command to place any locations (replacing one of the config settings).
- Upgrade command now has a second parameter to determine the operation (currently only tarpits).
