- visualize exclusion points (cylinders?)
- visualize which zones are included (draw zone corners without overlap)
- regenerate_location ???: nukes only a location (removes everything within exterior and respawns?)

- Command to find entities by component (some common ones like container, structure, creature).
 * This is slow so do a list operation.
- Some way to recommend verbose way (probably godo to be off on default..)
- generate command to accept a list of item ids which are force enabled in the vegetation?
