- visualize exclusion points (cylinders?)
- visualize which zones are included (draw zone corners without overlap)
- regenerate_location ???: nukes only a location (removes everything within exterior and respawns?)

Changes:

- Regeneration commands renamed to destroy to make the effect more clear.
- Destroy all command now requires biomes as a parameter (replacing the config setting and making harder to accidentally do things).
- New commands for generating areas without having to physically go there.
- New command for counting amount of entities.
- New command to place any locations (replacing one of the config settings).
- New command to reroll any chest.
- Upgrade command now has a second parameter to determine the operation (currently only tarpits).
- New upgrade command for generating onion seeds.
- New upgrade command for regenerating Mistlands.
- Added a new setting that prevents location placement on player bases (enabled by default).
